  welcome: Welcome
  objectif: "We\u2019re gonna build a fuel cell."
  suivant: Next
  oui: Yes
  non: No
  MenuPrincipale:
  - 'Fitting a fuel cell

'
  - Using a fuel cell
  Exit: Exit
  ExitMessage: do you want to exit the application?
  instruction: To assemble it, follow the onscreen instructions.
  suite: Next
  warning: "Pay attention to those around you, if you don\u2019t feel well or don\u2019t
    know what to do, feel free to ask for help."
  montage: Proceed to fuel cell assembly.
  stack: The first item we are going to place is the <b>Stack</b>, wich is mailny
    made up of <b>membranes</b>. These membranes will produce electricity from <b>Oxygen</b>
    and <b>Hydrogen</b>. Place the <b>Stack</b> on the location of the floating gray
    cube.
  H2: We are now going to deal with the <b>Hydrogen</b> circuit. It is one of the
    reactants necessary for the electrochemical reaction to take place within the
    <b>Stack</b>. The <b>Hydrogen</b> circuit is already positioned; connect the
    <b>Hydrogen</b> bottle to the end of the circuit.
  compresseur: After connecting the <b>Hydrogen</b>, we will connect the <b>Oxygen</b>.
    <b>Oxygen</b> is the other reagent required for the generation of <b>electricity</b>.
    In our case, we will use the <b>Oxygen</b> contained in the </b>Air. An Air filter
    is already positioned; it's up to you to put the <b>Compressor</b>.
  humidificateur: 'The membranes which make up the <b>Stack</b> are fragile components.
    To protect them, it is important to add <b>Humidity</b> to the <b>Air</b> entering
    the <b>Stack</b>.

    Therefore you have to place a <b>Humidifier</b> between
    the <b>Compressor</b> and the <b>Stack</b>.

'
  N2: "Now, Let's talk about security. \r\nHow do you stop the fuel cell when it
    is running?\r\nWe introduce <b>Nitrogen</b> instead of <b>Hydrogen</b> into the
    system; this  stops the reaction that takes place within the <b>Stack</b>. \r\nPlace
    the <b>Nitrogen</b> bottle. \r\n"
  ventilateur: "You may have noticed, but you\u2019ve placed the components at specific
    places.\r\nIf there is a leak of <b>Hydrogen</b> in this space, the gas will
    accumulate, and potentially cause an <b>explosion</b>. To avoid this accumulation,
    put a <b>fan</b> on the top.\r\n"
  H2O: "The <b>Fuel Cell</b> produces electricity, but also <b>water</b>. This Water
    must be evacuated, so we will collect it in a <b>Bin</b>. \r\nPlace the <b>bin</b>
    at the right place."
  radiateur: "The electrochemical reaction that takes place within the <b>Stack</b>
    generates <b>Heat</b> in addition to <b>electricity</b> and <b>water</b>.\r\nIn
    order for the <b>reaction</b> to be as <b>efficient</b> as possible, it must
    take place at a certain <b>temperature</b>.\r\nIn order to maintain this <b>temperature</b>,
    the <b>Stack</b> is connected to a <b>cooling system</b>.\r\nPlace the <b>Radiator</b>.\r"
  pilotage: Now, Control the <b>Fuel Cell</b>.
